      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always underestimated myself,<br>Always tried to humble myself,<br>But when it came to true affection.<br>Settling was out of the question</p>
<p>I used to settle for the ones in my league,<br>Continually thinking that my game was weak.<br>So what if she’s just alright?<br>It’s just a girl, am I not right?</p>
<p>But this is love we’re talking about,<br>A force larger than all doubts.<br>This girl could be my wife.<br>She could reflect my entire life.</p>
<p>And so when I saw the perfect one,<br>I thought, it’s her or none.<br>Might as well give it a shot.<br>For once I’ll be the man I’m not.</p>
<p>I chose her because she was the best.<br>I fell in love with her; God knows the rest.<br>Convincing myself I’m more than a mess,<br>God gave me perfection and nothing less.</p>
